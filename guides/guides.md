# Guides

This section of the Kontena documentation contains guides that show how to do individual tasks. A guide page shows how to do a single thing, typically by giving a short sequence of steps to accomplish the given task.

Guides are grouped together in categories by the topic they cover, so be sure to look for one in the correct category. And if you don't find one, you're always welcome to contribute a guide. See xyz for details.
